The .NET OCR SDK supports [custom-built API](https://developers.mindee.com/docs/build-your-first-document-parsing-api) from the API Builder. If your document isn't covered by one of Mindee's Off-the-Shelf APIs, you can create your own API using the [API Builder](https://developers.mindee.com/docs/overview).

For the following examples, we are using our own [W9s custom API](https://developers.mindee.com/docs/w9-forms-ocr) created with the [API Builder](https://developers.mindee.com/docs/overview).

## Quick Start

Imagine that you have built a new custom builder API with the name 'rent_insurance' within the company 'invest'.
And, of course, you have already train a first model.

```csharp
string path = "/src/mypath/myfile.pdf";
var prediction = await _mindeeClient
    .LoadDocument(new FileInfo(path))
    .ParseAsync(new Endpoint(
        "rent_insurance",
        "1", 
        "invest"));
```

Every time a new model is trained will required to update the version. This is probably not needed for development but essential for production use.

## Parsing Documents
Use the `parse` method to call the API prediction on your custom document.
The response class and document type must be specified when calling this method.

You have two different way to parse a custom document.

1. Use the default prediction class named ``CustomPrediction`` 
```csharp
var prediction = await _mindeeClient
                    .LoadDocument(new FileInfo(Path))
                    .ParseAsync(new Endpoint(
                        ProductName,
                        Version, 
                        OrganizationName));
```

2. You can also use your own class which will represent the required field. For example, with the custom objet below :
```csharp

// The Endpoint attribute is required when using you own model.
// It will be used to know which Mindee API called.
// Have a look on InvoiceV3 or ReceiptV4 objects
[Endpoint(productName: "rent_insurance", version:"1", organizationName:"invest")]
public sealed class RentInsurance
{
  [JsonPropertyName("insuree_name")]
  public StringField InsureeName { get; set; }

  [JsonPropertyName("dues")]
  public Amount Dues { get; set; }
}

var prediction = await _mindeeClient
                    .LoadDocument(new FileInfo(Path))
                    .ParseAsync<RentInsurance>();
```

## CustomPrediction object
All the fields defined in the API builder when creating your custom document are available.

`CustomPrediction` is a `Dictionary` with the key as a `string` for the name of the field and a `ListField` as a value, to hold the values extracted for this field. 

Value fields are accessed via the `Values` property.

> ðŸ“˜ **Info**
>
> Both document level and page level objects work in the same way.

### Fields property
A Map with the following structure:
* `Confidence`: a `double`
* `Values`: a list of `ListFieldValue` which containing a list of all values found for the field.

In the examples below we'll use the `insuree_name` field.

```csharp
string path = "/src/mypath/myfile.pdf";
var prediction = await _mindeeClient
    .LoadDocument(new FileInfo(path))
    .ParseAsync(new Endpoint(
        "rent_insurance",
        "1", 
        "invest"));

ListField? insureeName = prediction.Inference.Prediction.GetValueOrDefault("insuree_name");
```
